							A Dyson sphere is a megastructure that encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its power output. Thanks to that, our civilization will
							meet our energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the home planet's resources alone, which will soon happen.
						</p>
						<p class="fade-in">
							Because only a fraction of the energy of the sun reaches the surface of our planet, building structures encircling it would give us access to
							unlimited energy for the future.
						</p>
						<p class="fade-in">
							With advancements in AI, robotics, and space mining (such as missions from SpaceX and Blue Origin), we are closer than ever to building an
							experimental Dyson Swarm. Our project aims to test initial concepts in orbit and lay the groundwork for a future where humanity can tap into the
							limitless energy of the stars.

							<h3>The Dyson Concept</h3>
							<p>
								A Dyson Sphere is a massive structure designed to capture the energy of a star, like our Sun. Imagine a vast network of solar panels floating
								around the Sun, collecting an almost unlimited amount of energy. This energy could be used to power advanced civilizations, enable space
								exploration, and even solve Earth's energy crisis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our project focuses on a Dyson Swarm—a collection of satellites that harvest solar energy. Using advanced materials and wireless energy
								transmission, we aim to explore the foundations of a future where humanity can harness the full power of the stars.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="tech-image" style="background-image: url('vid1.webp')"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="tech-item fade-in">
						<div class="tech-content">
							<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
							<p>
								The Dyson Sphere concept is based on capturing as much energy as possible from a star by placing orbital structures around it. Instead of a solid
								shell (which is nearly impossible to build), we focus on a Dyson Swarm—thousands or even millions of autonomous solar satellites that collect and
								transmit energy via microwaves or lasers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Each satellite in our swarm functions independently, capturing solar energy and transmitting it back to collection stations near Earth. This
								modular approach allows for incremental deployment and continuous technological improvement.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="tech-image" style="background-image: url('vid2.webp')"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="tech-item fade-in">
						<div class="tech-content">
							<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
							<p>
								Building a Dyson Sphere is like trying to wrap a birthday present around the Sun while wearing oven mitts in zero gravity. Sure, we'll face
								"minor" obstacles like figuring out how to mine asteroids without accidentally sending one hurtling toward Earth, or developing materials that
								won't instantly vaporize when placed near a thermonuclear furnace. But hey, our team is staffed with optimists who think "impossible" is just a
								fancy word for "hasn't been attempted by people desperate enough." We've already ordered commemorative t-shirts that say "Either we'll harness
								unlimited energy or create the galaxy's most expensive light show."
							</p>
							<p>
								The logistics might seem daunting (where do you even store the assembly instructions for a structure larger than Earth's orbit?), but we've got
								solutions. Our engineers are working on self-replicating robots that will build the sphere for us, assuming they don't gain sentience and decide
								to build themselves a beach house on Mercury instead. As for the minor issue of potentially dimming sunlight to Earth and altering our climate
								forever – we've calculated that by the time anyone notices, we'll be too rich and powerful for it to matter! Rest assured, our contingency plans
								have contingency plans, and those plans primarily involve blaming any catastrophes on rival megaprojects or solar flares.
