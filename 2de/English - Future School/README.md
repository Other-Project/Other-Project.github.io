## Inter-connected High School

**In [Home page]( https://other-project.github.io/2de/English%20-%20Future%20School/index.html)** <BR />
Hello, we will introduce Inter-connected High School, our school of the future.  
We have redesigned the education system to better fit the new technologies' and the current expectations of the professional world. We want some kind of partnership with our students. Team spirit is the key in Inter-connected High School.   
Our project is to bring concrete to the theoretical lessons by involving professionals from the subjects covered. We want to bring a more real and practical vision by promoting exchanges between our students and these professionals through digital meetings in particular. It's about opening up to the professional world in parallel with general studies through partnerships and the study of particular cases. We open the borders by developing throughout the program exchanges between our students and professors around the world through videoconferencing.  
Priority is given to the use of digital tools to keep pace with current technological advances.  
An important place is also given to theatrical and entertainment activities because we think that it's important for students to feel self-confident in front of an audience.  
Also, we want to involve parents in the organization of sport events, meetings, prom and fancy-dress balls, ...
