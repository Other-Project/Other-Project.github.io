### Hydrogen, an alternative to the 100% electric car

Since a few years, the issue of sustainable development is increasingly present in debates upon the ecological transition. Electric cars are just starting to replace the combustion engine cars, while a new alternative to the 100% electric car is on the way. Electric cars could be quite obsolete in the years to come. Indeed, thanks to the recent innovations of Haffner Energy, hydrogen could be a more interesting alternative. 
Firstly, hydrogen is a solution to the issue of waste management because the production of hydrogen can be made from biomass. The biomass deposit produced in France each year is more important than the quantity of oil that we import. Therefore, the cost of production is similar to that of fossil fuels!
In addition, hydrogen cars have more autonomy than electric cars. The hydrogen car Hyundai Nexo, can travel up to 800 km without refuelling. The operation of fuel cells, used to produce energy, is based on the reaction of the oxygen found in the air and the hydrogen contained in the tank. The energy produced is then used by an electric motor. The advantages of using this mechanism are:     
- the speed of recharging (10 minutes for hydrogen versus 40 for electric cars),
- smaller batteries since the stored energy only results from the deceleration
- and finally, less lithium needed.
  On the other hand, a problem arises: how to democratize hydrogen? 
  The answer is not that simple because hydrogen requires more investment from the petrol stations. Indeed, there are very few infrastructures in France that are equipped with hydrogen pumps. And as we know, if there are no stations, nobody buys a hydrogen car, and if nobody has a hydrogen car, stations will not invest in hydrogen pumps... Itâ€™s a vicious circle. Fortunately, Haffner Energy has found a solution: hydrogen can also be used to produce syngas, which could be purposed at a price comparable to that of natural gas. Syngas could be used by municipalities in their gas networks. This would be a good action for ecology and would help raising funds to create more hydrogen stations all over France. The city of Strasbourg has announced that 50% of its network will be powered by hydrogen by 2021. 
  In conclusion, hydrogen cars are an interesting alternative to 100% electric cars and we will hear a lot about it in the years to come.

**Hydrogen:** The lightest of all gases and the most abundant element in the universe.
**Fossil fuel:** A hydrocarbon-based fuel, such as petroleum, coal, or natural gas, derived from living matter of a previous geologic time.
**Biomass:** Plant or animal material, such as forestry by-products or agricultural waste, that is used as a fuel or energy source.
**Syngas:** A mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
